# HealthcareSQL

In this project, used SQL Server to provide valuable insights to a fictional hospital.
I aimed to answer the following questions:

--Is there any correlation between exercise frequency and blood pressure levels?  <br />
--What are the most common reasons for hospital visits?  <br />
--What is the average cost of a hospital visit, and how does it vary by treatment type?  <br />
--Which doctor has the most patients assigned, and what is the average number of visits per patient for each doctor?  <br />
--Is there any difference in the average cost of treatments provided by different doctors? <br />
--What is the relationship between exercise frequency and the need for follow-up visits? <br /> 

After the data analysis procedure, I concluded the following answers to the business questions:

There was not a huge correlation between exercise frequency and blood pressure levels. This could be a data gathering issue.  <br />
The most common visit for the hospital was for a cholesterol check.  <br />
Dr. Smith has the highest number of patients. Dr. Adams and Dr. Johnson had 2 visits on average per patient. Dr. Lee and Dr. Smith had 1 visit on average per patient.  <br />
The average cost of treatments did vary by the doctor. Dr. Smith had the overall lowest average cost at $262, and Dr. Adams had the highest overall average cost at $309.  <br />
From the available data, it is seen that people who worked out frequently had the most follow ups, but that may be due to them having more people in that category.  <br />
